Game title: Party-Rex

Lore:   
        According to the latest discoveries Dinosaurs risked to become extinct 
        out of pure boredom. They mostly wandered around lazily, ate something 
        slept, pooped... you know the typical dinosaurs life. One species saw the 
        dangers of boredom in advance and evolved an instinct to party and kill 
        the boredom. A wonderful creation of mother nature direct descendant of 
        the T-REX: the PAR-T-REX. The individuals of this species were real party 
        souls. They got the party started and got all the other dinos to dance. 
        Saving them from the inevitable death from boredom. Unfortunately some 
        years later a meteorite hit the earth real hard. In that moment the dinos
        were all gathered for a huge party. A lesson was learned that day: dancing 
        may save you from boredom but not from a massive, high-speed space wandering 
        stone. 

Gameplay: 
        You play as one of the Par-t-rex and have to dance to the beat to get all the 
        other dinos to dance. With M and K you have to hit the beat in the beatbar at 
        the right timing. When you hit your influence radius becomes bigger and if there 
        are dinos near you they will start dancing. If you miss the beats your influence 
        radius will shrink and the dinos will stop dancing and wander around bored once again. 
        When all the dinos are dancing you win the game. The music volume and disco-tiles 
        are adapting to the game: the sounds and colors vary based on the amount of dinos 
        dancing.

Possible future improvements:
        I think screen shake would have a huge impact on the game to give the player a better 
        feedback of the beat. In general a lot of visual polish could be added to the game and 
        new gameplay elements can be introduced to increase variety of gameplay.
